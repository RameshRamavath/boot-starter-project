    // why spring framework is so famous

    /*
       Back in 2000 we used use lots of EJB - Enterprise Java Beans to create any enterprise applications
       - bast for messaging, look up of entities etc
       - problem is entities are heavy and we came with POJO -- and POJO is included in Spring framework

       --> with Spring framework we can work with

       -- POJO = Plain Old Java Object
       -- Dependency Injection
       -- MVC - model-view-controller
       -- REST
       -- Security
       -- BATCH
       -- DATA
       -- AOP


with all these features we can achieve any business purpose - hence Spring Framework became very famous

Also we can integrate this with Other frameworks like Hibernate, Struts


But we have problems here:::

===>  Business application
   1. Need of some external Jar files
   2. Some configurations -- for big enterprise applications we need to add so many configurations


   Code more - less configure --> here comes the Spring boot

   Idea of spring boot is to give us production ready applications in quick time

   Also no need to have web server to run our application -- Application Jar file will have embeded tomcat server


   Spring boot has so many starter projects which helps us to create enterprise applications faster

   spring-boot-starter-web
   spring-boot-starter-jdbc

   We don't have XML files to modify the Configurations in Spring boot -- we can use application.properties file to configure our application
