##     SpringFramework Journey - Need of Spring Boot

*Why spring framework is so famous??*

       Back in 2000 developers used to use lots of EJB - Enterprise Java Beans to create any enterprise applications
       
       ** EJB's are Best for messaging, look up of entities etc
       ** But, the problem is entities are heavy and hence we came with POJO ** and POJO is included in Spring framework

**With Spring framework developer can work/use all below items**

       ** POJO = Plain Old Java Object
       ** Dependency Injection
       ** MVC - model-view-controller
       ** REST
       ** Security
       ** BATCH
       ** DATA
       ** AOP


      With all these features we can achieve any business purpose - hence Spring Framework became very famous

      Also we can integrate this with Other frameworks like Hibernate, Struts


**Developers have problems here also**

   *Business application*
   
   1. Need of some external Jar files
   2. Some configurations - means for bigger enterprise applications we need to add so many configurations


   and here comes the need of Code more or work more on business logic implementation and less on configure -- here comes the **Spring boot**

   **Idea of spring boot is to give us production ready applications in quick time**

   Also no need to have web server to run our application - Spring Boot Application Jar file will have embeded tomcat server


   Spring boot has so many **starter projects** which helps us to create enterprise applications faster

   spring-boot-starter-web
   spring-boot-starter-jdbc

   developer don't have XML files to modify the Configurations in Spring boot -  developer can use **application.properties** file to configure our application
